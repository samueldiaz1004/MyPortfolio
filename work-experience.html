		<b>Date: </b>August 2023 - July 2025 <br>
		<b>Description:</b> I worked on designing and
		implementing new features for the oneAPI packaging system and proprietary installer. This involved
		development across multiple operating systems (Linux, macOS, Windows), distribution formats (deb, rpm, PyPI,
		Conda, NuGet), and languages like Python and Shell scripting. I helped migrate and integrate existing
		systems into a more transparent model for stakeholders, and supported adoption by creating
		onboarding materials and tooling. I also investigated and resolved issues, contributed fixes, and maintained
		the test suite to ensure consistent, high-quality releases. Additionally, I authored internal documentation
		and updated user guides to reflect newly implemented features.<br>
		<b>Programming languages:</b> Python, Shell Scripting and Perl. <br>
		<b>Tecnologies:</b> Git, GitHub Actions, Linux, Docker and Pytest. <br>
